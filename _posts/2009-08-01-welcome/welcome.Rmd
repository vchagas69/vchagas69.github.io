```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Being this the first post, it would be the perfect place to state what I intend to accomplish with the blog.

The idea was to have a place where I could document my findings regarding literature, techniques and software that could simplify (my) work as an actuary.

Hopefully it will be helpful for someone else (than me) and I apologize for my English :)

**Note:** I'm compiling and translating from Portuguese some posts from my other blogs.
